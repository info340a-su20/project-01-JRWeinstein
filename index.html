        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        
        <p>Food insecurity is a major problem in the United States.
            Despite being one of the most developed countries in the world, there is a significant population that is unable to have their basic food needs met.
            Those most disadvantaged by this lack of resources include:
            <ul>
                <li>Young families; with rising economic economic uncertainty coupled with a higher cost of living, young families are finding it more difficult to maintain a balanced diet.</li>
                <li>The elderly; those on fixed income with low mobility are both economically and physically unable to get food.</li>
                <li>Students; college students living on their own with little disposable income and rising student debt often cut corners at the expense of their nutritional wellbeing.</li>
            </ul>
            Some key insights are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>In America, 40% of the food supply becomes waste during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/14/from-field-to-fork-the-six-stages-of-wasting-food">farm-to-table lifecycle</a>. Average meal waste hovers around 20%. And according to the USDA, depending on the area, between 30% and 60% of garden produce is wasted because it isnâ€™t picked.</li>
            <li>A pound of mixed vegetables contains 300 calories and 35% of daily vitamins and minerals. 1 in 3 American homes has a garden, and each will lose on average 30 pounds of produce per year due to negligence.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.northwestharvest.org/updated-food-insecurity-and-poverty-numbers">food insecurity rate</a> for all senior households was 7.8% in 2016, up from 5.5% in 2001. At the same time, the percentage of seniors facing the threat of hunger has more than doubled.</li>
            <li>Rising cost of living is a major factor towards why young people are not getting a balanced diet.</li>
            <li>COVID, average weight gain has increased due largely to the sedentary lifestyle necessitated by social distancing but also by the poorer quality of cheap food purchased during times of economic uncertainty.</li>
            <li>There exists enough food to feed everyone, which means this is a problem of logistics not resources.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Growing Together, Giving Together</h2>
        <p>
            Were existing food able to be connected to people in need, issues with food insecurity would be drastically reduced.
            This can be achieved, at least in part, by taking advantage of excess food from the consumer space.
            This would most often take the form of home and community gardens.
            By leveraging community participation in both populating the known sources of food (their own gardens) and getting people to volunteer for collection or delivery, we would be able to put a dent in food insecurity and waste.
            The goal is to coordinate available sources of free food and the manpower necessary to collect it, either for others or the individual.
            Further, this could also bolster community cohesion as it is akin to breaking bread.
